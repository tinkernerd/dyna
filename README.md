# Overview

A self-updating photo portfolio that:

* Builds albums and extracts EXIF metadata automatically
* Requires **no CMS**, **no database**, and **no backend configuration**
* Updates instantly when you add, remove, or rearrange photos
* Now supports **drop-in Docker deployment** with a clean `/data` volume

Nice! Since you have a **live demo**, let’s update the README to highlight it cleanly and professionally.

Below is a polished version of your README section with a **Demo badge**, a direct link, and a clean call-to-action—styled in a way that fits GitHub norms and doesn’t step on your buddy’s original content.

You can preview the Docker-enhanced version of the Dynamic Photo Portfolio here:

👉 **[https://dyno.tinkernerd.dev](https://dyno.tinkernerd.dev)**

This instance uses:

* The `/server` + `/data` folder structure
* Dockerized runtime
* Auto-generated thumbnails
* A real About page
* Multiple albums for testing

---


# ⭐ Features

* **Autogenerated albums** — each folder in `photos/` becomes an album
* **Auto updating** — refresh the page and new photos appear
* **EXIF metadata** — camera, lens, aperture, shutter, ISO, focal length
* **Location & description support** — add a `.md` or `.txt` file with the same name
* **Custom About Page** — edit the Markdown file to update instantly
* **Lazy loading** for efficient browsing
* **Thumbnail pipeline** — faster compressed previews
* **Fullscreen viewer**
* **Chronological sorting**
* **Zero database required**
* **Runs everywhere** (Node server, VPS, or now Docker)

---

# 📝 About Page

The site includes a simple, customizable “About Me” page.

![aboutpage\_demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b407d08-d9ea-4857-863a-a6840c72da0f)

* Edit the `about.md` file in the `data/` folder
* Save
* Reload the site

---

# 🏷️ Location Tagging & Descriptions

To add location or description text for a photo:

1. Create a `.md` or `.txt` file with the same name
2. Put it next to the photo

Example:

```
photos/
  └── travel/
        ├── tokyo.jpg
        ├── tokyo.md       ← description or location
```

![location\_demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/319ddeda-4224-4623-ab00-5fd5f6a92a1b)

# 🧩 Project Structure (Enhanced)

This version separates **server code** from **user data**.

```
Dyna/
├── server/
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── public/
│   └── package.json
└── data/
    ├── about.md
    ├── photos/
    └── thumbs/    ← generated automatically
```

This ensures:

* Code stays clean
* User content stays isolated
* Docker mounts only the `/data` directory

---

# 🐳 Docker Support (Added by @tinkernerd)

Run the entire portfolio with one command.

### **docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
services:
  dyna-photosite:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: dyna-photosite
    restart: unless-stopped

    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

### **Run it**

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Open:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### **All user content lives in `/data`**

* `data/photos` — your albums
* `data/thumbs` — auto-generated
* `data/about.md` — About page

This keeps deployments clean and reproducible.
